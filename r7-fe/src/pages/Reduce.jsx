<h1>Several statistic facts to consider</h1> <br />

<ul>
    <li><p>Producing new products can create a large carbon footprint. For example, did you know that on average manufacturing a brand new sofa generates 90kg of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is roughly equivalent to driving a car for 220 miles? At the same time, 100,000 tonnes of appliances are sent to waste facilities and landfill over the winter period alone. <br />
</p><br />

</figure></li>
    <li><p>The fashion industry accounts for about 8-10% of global carbon emissions, and nearly 20% of wastewater. And while the environmental impact of flying is now well known, fashion sucks up more energy than both aviation and shipping combined.
</p><br /></li>
    <li><p>Did you know that a single pair of jeans requires a kilogram of cotton. And because cotton tends to be grown in dry environments, producing this kilo requires about 7,500U+002d10,000 litres of water. That is about <b>10 years worth of drinking water for one person.</b> </p> <br />

</figure></li>
    <li>The "mountain" of waste electronic and electrical equipment discarded in 2021 will weigh more than 57 million tonnes, researchers have estimated.

That is heavier than the Great Wall of China - the planet's heaviest artificial object.
