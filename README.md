# R7: Making Zero Waste Possible

**Front End Hosted on [Heroku](https://non-binary-code-r7.netlify.app/)  
List of All API Endpoints on [Heroku](https://r7-api-athena.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html)  
Product Demonstration on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Deeo_B-Es)**  

## Rationale

Our rationale is simple: To connect people who have things they no longer need, with people who need them. Doing this, we can reduce waste and we can help people avoid spending money during this cost of living crisis.

## User Interface

### Design

We have designed the website to feature seven principles of waste management, each bringing different functionality to the site. Re-use features a listing of items which can be ordered for free.

### Accessibility

Of particular importance to us was acknowledging the need for accessibility in line with the [WCAG Guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). Although this project was created quickly for a hackathon, Non-Binary Code has several disabled members, including one who is visually impaired.

We checked our brand colours on the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) to ensure the text had sufficient contrast with the background for it to be readable. We also endeavoured to preserve the correct structure within the HTML document outline so that screen readers can be more easily used to navigate the site. Alternative text was provided for images where we were able, and in future should be expanded to include more detail and better description.

## Non-Binary Code

Non-Binary Code are [Dane Whitfield](https://github.com/danewhitfield), [Galina Ostroumova](https://github.com/ostroumova), [Jason Clifton](https://github.com/JasonClifton), [Yousef Ajdabiya](https://github.com/YousefToast) and [Zan Clifton](https://github.com/ZanClifton). For a collection of well used and tired out objects given a fresh coat of coding paint, they rub together pretty well!
